*What is Google Vision API?
Google has done the hard work of training computer vision models with lots of
images using Google&#39;s vast compute resources. It has also exposed these models
via REST APIs and even made SDKs available with client libraries in multiple
languages, so you don&#39;t have to know anything about REST, much less computer
vision. You just send Google an image and request a task, such as object
detection or face detection. Then Google will charge you a little money and send
the results back. You can easily use the Cloud Vision API to integrate computer
vision into your apps.
*Google Vision API Set up
The API must be enabled for a project in the Google Cloud Platform Console
online.
*Integrate Google Cloud APIs and Firebase SDK
Google Cloud Storage APIs can be used to access files uploaded via Firebase
SDKs for Cloud Storage, especially to perform more complex operations, such as
copying or moving a file, or listing all the files available at a reference. 
* Logo Detection and Pattern Emotion Detection 
Using Google Vision API, we can predict the facial emotions of the person in the
image. Using similar patterns of emotion like Sad or Happy the person’s Happy
moments can be made Collage together. This helps to track the Person’s
emotional pattern.
